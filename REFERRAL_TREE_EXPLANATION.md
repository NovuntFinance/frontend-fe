# Referral Tree Display - Complete Explanation

## Overview

Your referral tree is now displaying correctly! Here's what everything means:

---

## 📊 **Summary Statistics**

### **"1 total referrals • 0 active"**

- **Total Referrals (1)**: This counts ALL users who signed up using your referral code, regardless of whether they've staked anything yet.
  - Your referral: `test@novunt.test` (joined Nov 29, 2025)

- **Active Referrals (0)**: This counts only referrals who have a **qualifying stake** (minimum $20 USDT staked in active goals).
  - Currently: 0 because `test@novunt.test` hasn't staked the minimum amount yet.

---

## 💰 **Earnings Section**

### **Total Earned: $0.00**

This shows the **total amount you've earned from referral bonuses** throughout your entire history.

**Why it's $0.00:**

- You only earn referral bonuses when your referrals **stake money in goals**
- The referral (`test@novunt.test`) hasn't staked anything yet, so no bonuses have been generated
- Even if they stake, you only earn bonuses if:
  1. They stake at least $20 USDT (qualifying stake)
  2. You also have a qualifying stake ($20+ USDT) yourself

### **Current Balance: $3,010.26**

This is your **earning wallet balance** - it includes:

- Referral bonuses (currently $0)
- Other earnings (ROI, team bonuses, etc.)
- The $3,010.26 is likely from other sources, not referrals

**Note:** This balance is separate from your main wallet balance.

## 👤 **Referral Details**

### **User: test (test@novunt.test)**

**Status: Inactive**

- **What it means:** The referral doesn't have a qualifying stake yet
- **How to become Active:** They need to stake at least $20 USDT in active goals
- **Impact:** You won't earn referral bonuses from them until they become active

**Status: Pending**

- **What it means:** Same as "Inactive" - waiting for them to stake the minimum amount
- **When it changes:** When they stake $20+ USDT, status changes to "Qualified"

**Level 1 • 5% Commission**

- **Level 1:** Direct referral (first level in your tree)
- **5% Commission:** You earn 5% of their qualifying stake amounts and earnings
- **Commission Structure:**
  - Level 1: 5%
  - Level 2: 2%
  - Level 3: 1.5%
  - Level 4: 1%
  - Level 5: 0.5%
  - Level 6+: 0% (no bonuses, but they still count toward team stake)

## 🔄 **How Referral Bonuses Work**

### **When You Earn Bonuses:**

1. **Your referral stakes in a goal** (minimum $20 USDT)
2. **You have a qualifying stake** yourself ($20+ USDT)
3. **Bonuses are calculated:**
   - 5% of their stake amount (one-time when they stake)
   - 5% of their weekly earnings (ongoing)

### **Example Scenario:**

If `test@novunt.test` stakes $100 USDT:

- You earn: $100 × 5% = **$5.00** (one-time bonus)
- If they earn $10 weekly ROI, you earn: $10 × 5% = **$0.50** (weekly)

## ❓ **Common Questions**

### **Q: Why is my referral "Inactive" but they joined?**

**A:** Joining doesn't make them active. They need to stake at least $20 USDT in active goals.

### **Q: Why is Total Earned $0 but Current Balance is $3,010.26?**

**A:**

- **Total Earned** = Only referral bonuses earned
- **Current Balance** = All earnings (referrals + ROI + team bonuses + etc.)
- Your $3,010.26 is from other sources, not referrals

### **Q: When will I start earning from this referral?**

**A:** When:

1. They stake $20+ USDT in a goal
2. You also have $20+ USDT staked
3. Then you'll earn 5% of their activities

### **Q: What happens if my referral never stakes?**

**A:** They'll remain "Inactive" and you won't earn any bonuses from them. They still count as a referral for team/rank purposes.

### **Q: Can I see how much I've earned from each referral?**

**A:** Yes! Check your transaction history - referral bonuses are recorded there with details about which referral generated them.

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

✅ **1 total referral** = Someone joined using your code  
⏳ **0 active** = They haven't staked the minimum yet  
💰 **$0.00 earned** = No bonuses generated yet (they need to stake first)  
💵 **$3,010.26 balance** = Other earnings, not from referrals  
📊 **5% commission** = Your earning rate when they become active

The system is working correctly! Your referral just needs to stake to start generating bonuses for you.
